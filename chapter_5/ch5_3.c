/* C Programming A Modern Approach
 * Chapter 5
 * Exercise 3                                                                    
 *                                                                             
 * Modified version of the broker.c program of Secion 5.2 by making both of the
 * following changes:
 *
 * (a) Asks the user to enter the number of shares and the price per share, 
 * instead of the value of the trade
 *
 * (b) Adds statements that compute the commision charged by a rival broker
 * ($33 plus 3 cents per share for fewer than 2000 shares; $33 plus 2 cents per
 * share for 2000 shares or more). Display the rival's commission as well as the
 * commission charged by the original broker.
